If you ever want to use something in your local environment based on your customization and in need of using environment files other than default (.env), you can add some variables to your .env.local file. 
Create a `.env.local` file using `.env` as your template in your root directory :

```
# Mimoto Server
MIMOTO_HOST =  https://api.collab.mosip.net/

# ESignet Server
ESIGNET_HOST =  https://esignet.collab.mosip.net/

# Telemetry Server
OBSRV_HOST = https://dataset-api.obsrv.mosip.net
Telemetry Dashboard = https://druid.obsrv.mosip.net/unified-console.html#workbench

## Building & Running for Android

Refer to the documentation of Inji Wallet's [build and deployment android section](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/build-and-deployment#android-build-and-run) for the steps build the android application.

Note: Alternative to building and running app via react native CLI, it can be built via Android Studio. The app is available in this repository's `./android` directory. Open this directory in Android Studio (version  
4.1 and above) and the app can be built and run from there.

More info here:
- [Build your app using Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run)


## Building & Running for iOS

Refer to the documentation of Inji Wallet's [build and deployment iOS section](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/build-and-deployment#ios-build-and-run) for the steps build the iOS application.

- [Apple Developer - Distributing Your App for Beta Testing and Releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases)

### Note 

When application is built via IDE, metro need to be started manually (For instance, if building app via XCode open metro manually, as metro hook has been removed from building via XCode - [reference](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/42173#issuecomment-1921091973)). 
However, if app is built via npm commands, metro starts automatically (For instance, `npm run android:mosip` or `npm run ios`)

## Known Issues

- **Terminal Configuration Error**
   
  When attempting to build the application using certain terminals via npm commands, you may encounter the following error:

    ```
    Cannot start server in new windows because no terminal app was specified, use --terminal to specify, or start a dev server manually by running npm start or yarn start in other terminal window.
    ```
  **Cause:** 
    - This issue occurs due to missing or incorrect terminal configuration or environment settings.
  
  **Workaround:**
  - Start the development server manually by running `npm start` in a separate terminal window.
